<h1>"kOkO" Number</h1>
<br>
Komal is very fond of discovering new types of number. She discovered a new category of number, named "kOkO" number. A number is called "kOkO" number, if it consists only of digits 4 and 7. For example, 44, 747, 4 are "kOkO" numbers, but 745, 423, 111 are not.
Now Komal is interested in evaluating smallest "kOkO" number in range [L, R].
<br>Your task is to develop a program that evaluates the smallest "kOkO" number in the given range and if none then print -1;
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br>For L = 1 and R = 2 the output should be -1.
<br>For L = 4 and R = 7 the output should be 4.
<br><br><b>Input</b>
<br>The first line contains an integer 't', denoting the number of test cases.
<br>Next 't' lines consists of two space seperated integers 'L' and 'R', where L and R represent the range.
<br><br><b>Output</b>
<br>For each given range you need to print a single integer (smallest "kOkO" number), if no "kOkO" number found then print -1.
<br><b>Constraints: </b>
<br>1 <= t <= 1000
<br>1 <= L,R <=10000<br>
<br><br><b>Sample Test Case:</b>
<br><b>Input:</b>
<br>2
<br>1 2
<br>4 7
<br><br><b>Output:</b>
<br>-1
<br>4
