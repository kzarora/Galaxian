Search of life led Captain Harmit and his team to traverse many Solar Systems, and he also succeed, he a reached a Planet 'ADA' here peoples talk in same language english but there documents are very strange everything is numeric, Using his wise Witt he observed some pattern in there documents, make a program to convert a numeric data into text data so he can also make report about their literature.
<br>The pattern was every word can be written using 26 integers where each integer of index i means no of occurrence of that alphabet in a word, but there was a condition, character represented by index i can be place on position j in word if and only if j%i==0,Arr1 is occurrence of 'a',Arr2 is occurrence of 'b',.....,Arr26 is occurrence of 'z'.       
<br>Your task is to make a program for helping Captain Harmit to find a Lexicographically Smallest word of length n Using and Array of 26 Integers Arr[]
<br><br>
<b>Input</b>
<br>
First Line is Number A which is denoting no of Test Cases.
<br>First line of each Test case has an Integers N i.e. length of word.
<br>Second line of each Test Case is 26 space separated integers Arr[]  
<br><br>
<b>Output</b>
<br>
Print Lexicographically smallest word of lenght n following above rules, if no such word can be formed print "ADAVENTURE" in new line. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Some extra characters are there to confuse you it doesnt mean to use all.
<br><br>
<b>Constraints</b>
<br>1<= A <=100
<br>1<= N <=400
<br>0<=Arri<=n
<br><br><b>Example</b>
<br><b>Input:</b>
<br>1
<br>5
<br>3 1 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
