<b>INPUT:</b>
<br>T is the number of test cases.
<br>	Followed by two lines for a test case first line contains Six space seperated numbers denotiong occurence of each face while testing biasedness of Dice.
<br>	And second line containing S(sum on all three dices).
	

<br><b>OUTPUT:</b> 
<br>Contains the proabilities of corresponding test case.
<br><br>
<b>Example:</b>
