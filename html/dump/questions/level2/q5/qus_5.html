<h1>Wise Milkman</h1>
<br>
A wise Milkman Suresh is having very good Managerial Skills, from his experience of 10 years of milk selling he brought his business to a very good scale and now he is covering N cities, but he notices because of this huge network of cities he need to travel a lot and so causes extra cost for him to sell milk, he decided to one is more branches so that each branch will be covering many cities to supply milk, but capital investment to open N branches is too much and unnecessary so he decided to take a group of cities A such that for each road connecting only 2 cities there should be at least 1 city in that group, but he also willing if a city with Even Index is there in a group than its next consecutive city should not be in a group, Help Suresh to form a group. 
<br>Your task is to tell Suresh in advance is such grouping is possible or not?<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> there are N cities with index 1,2,3...N and R roads i.e. (i,j) connecting city i and j where 1<=i,j<=N i!=j.
<br><br><b>Input</b>
<br>The first line of the input contains a single integer A denoting the number of test cases. 
<br>For each test Case
<br>The first line contains two space-separated integers N and R denoting the number of Cities and number of Roads.
<br>Each R lines of test Case have two space-separated integers i and j denoting a Road between City i and j.
<br><br><b>Output</b>
<br>In new line Print "EXIST" and "NOT EXIST"
<br>if solution exist than print index of city in a group in new line seperated by space.

<br><br><b>Constraints</b>
<br>1 <= A <= 200
<br>1 <= N <= 50000
<br>0 <= R <= 100000

<br><br><b>Example</b>
<br><b>Input</b>
<br>1
<br>5 5
<br>1 2
<br>2 3
<br>3 4
