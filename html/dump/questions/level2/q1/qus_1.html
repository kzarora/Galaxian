<h1>Scerete Chatting</h1>
<br>
Genius are not made in a day, and so was our Captain Harmit, since his childhood he was very interested in math and computers science in his school day he and his friend Pari use pass a messages to each other, to maintain privacy they used an encrypting algorithm.
<br>Encryption Include a message that is converted into a bit stream using ASCII format of 8 bits and a hash key k.
<br>Encrypting Algorithm was to increase size of message stream k times by 1 bit and left shifting it(or appending 0 as Right Bit) by 1 bit each of k iterations than XOR ing these K streams. 
Few year later Harmit wants to decode some old messages and remember those days can you Decrypt these messages for Harmit.
<br><br>
<b>Input Format</b>
<br>First line contains A no of test cases.
<br>The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K i.e. length of encrypted bit stream and hash key Resp.
<br>The second line contains bit stream consist of ones and zeros.
<br><br>
<b>Constraints</b>
<br>1 <= A <= 200
<br>1 <= N <= 2000
<br>1 <= K <= 100 
<br><br>
<b>Output Format</b>
<br>
Decoded message and print text. 
<br>If ASCII value message is not in an of alphabhet of Capital Case than use 'value%26' character considerind A is at index '0'
<br><br>
<b>Example</b>
<br>1
<br>18 3
<br>011111100111111111
<br><br>
Output:
<br>HI
<br><br>
<b>Explaination</b>
<br><pre>
0100100001001001
<br> 0100100001001001
<br>  0100100001001001
<br>------------------
<br>011111100111111111
</pre>
<br><br>which is binary equivalent of HI and 'H' and 'I' both belongs to [A....Z].
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> If you are not getting what they talk dont worry! its their matter of business just print it !!.
