<h1>Food Packing</h1>
<br>In space distance is measured in terms of Light years, Although Udyan (Space Craft) is very capable of traveling such Distance but still it might take Years from one
Planet to another. For Survival in mission Captain Harmit and his team needs food, but food months and years takes lot of space in a space craft. 
To efficiently store food ISRO develop a special Rectangular wrap for breads in which 3 Bread Slices to be stored side by side but size of wrap is 
much larger than 3 breads (Breads are square in shape and of equal size), Breads are arranged such a way that one side of each bread is in complete contact 
with a bottom side of wrap (let’s say X axis).
So, the coordinates of center of 3 breads are (X1, S/2), (X2, S/2) and (X3, S/2), we can move each bread by K units such that that side always remain in contact with X axis
<br>
Yours task is to find efficiency in putting bread i.e. the maximum area that can be formed where all 3 breads overlap each other

<br><br><b>Input</b>
<br>First Line is A denoting no of test cases
<br>In each Testcase pair of 1st line is consisting S side of a square bread, K the distance by which we can move on each bread.
<br>Second Line of each test case consist of 3 numbers denoting X coordinate of center of breads, 
<br><br>
<b>Output</b>
<br>Print Maximum area of overlapping of 3 breads output should be upto 2 decimal places. 
<br><br><b>Constraints</b>

<br>1 <= A <= 200
<br>1 <= S <= 20000
<br>0 <= K <= 20000
<br>-1000 <= Xi <= 1000
<br><br><b>Example</b>
<br><b>Input</b>
<br>1
<br>1 1
<br>1 2 3
<br>
<br><b>Output</b>
<br>1.00
<br>
<br><b>Explaination</b>
<br> Bread with center(1,1)shift rightward 1 unit so new center (2,1)
<br>Bread with center (3,1) shift left by 1 unit so center become(2,1)
<br>so all 3 bread sandwitched so area = 1 square unit
