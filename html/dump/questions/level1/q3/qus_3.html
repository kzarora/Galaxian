The Team try to convert that Numeric Stream into a Palindrome of Maximum Numeric Value Character Stream. If this is possible than Message is noise free and will be decrypted into original Message else noisy and need re transmission.
<br>It’s a situation of Urgency can you help Team Udyan in its sub task of finding is it noisy or not?
<br><br><b>Input Format</b>
<br>First Line contains A no of Test case.
<br>First Line of each Testcase have 2 Numbers N no of characters in a Stream, K i.e. the maximum Hits allowed
<br>Second Line of Each Test case will have a Numeric Character Stream 
<br><br>
<br><b>Constraints</b>
<br>1 <= A <= 200
<br>1 <= N <= 2000000
<br>1 <= K <= 2000000
<br><br>
<b>Output Format</b>
<br>Print the Maximum Possible Palindrome Stream and in new line "No Noise"
<br>If not Possible Print -1 and in new line "Retransmit"
<br><br>
<b>Example:</b>
<b><br>Input</b>
